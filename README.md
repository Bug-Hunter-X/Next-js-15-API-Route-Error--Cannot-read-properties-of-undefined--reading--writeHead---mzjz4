# Next.js 15 API Route Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'writeHead')

This repository demonstrates a strange bug encountered when upgrading a Next.js 14 application to Next.js 15.  A seemingly simple API route intermittently throws a `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'writeHead')` error. This error does not consistently reproduce and appears to be related to other parts of the application's execution.  The bug does not manifest in Next.js 14.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe the intermittent error. (The error's occurrence might be inconsistent)

## Potential Causes

The root cause is unknown, but possible explanations include:

* **Asynchronous operations:** A race condition between the API route and other asynchronous tasks within the application.
* **Middleware interference:**  Potential conflicts with other middleware functions, causing unexpected behavior.
* **Next.js 15 internal changes:**  Differences in the way Next.js 15 handles API route responses compared to Next.js 14. 

## Solution (Workaround)

The current workaround involves carefully reviewing asynchronous operations and potentially restructuring the code to prevent race conditions.  The provided `bugSolution.js` shows this approach. (A complete and definitive fix for the root cause is still being investigated.)
